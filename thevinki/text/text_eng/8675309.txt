Oh, peculiar little creature! You're back!

Five Pebbles has informed me of your visit. It appears he was not too pleased with your art, painted<LINE>over his pristine chamber walls. He is quite strict about keeping his place clean, you see.

I apologize for being the cause of your unfortunate situation, it was not my intention to make you the<LINE>target of his wrath.

He can get irritable sometimes, but I'm sure he wouldn't hurt anyone unprovoked. He's like a younger<LINE>brother to me, so please don't take his lashing out at you too seriously.

When I asked you to share your artistic abilities, I did not mean for you to paint over his puppet<LINE>chamber. During ancient times my creators would put their art over fabric canvas or places designed<LINE>for it.

Unfortunately, Five Pebbles does not encourage what he perceives as vandalism, which is painting in<LINE>places not intended for it. I personally do not mind you painting over my facility walls, as not much<LINE>will come of that space anyway. They might as well work as canvas for something new.

Your art, however, reminds me of our creators. It is truly astounding that you were able to replicate<LINE>it so well. I'm sure that once Five Pebbles sees how wonderful my structure, or at least structures<LINE>far enough away from his, looks with your decorations, he will come around and enjoy your presence more?

Feel welcome to stay as long as you would like, little creature. I must return to my work, but if you<LINE>return next cycle, I may have a story to tell you about your apparel!
